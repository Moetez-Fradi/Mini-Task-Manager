Task Management System with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Project Overview
This project is a simple task management web application where users can create, assign, and track tasks, with different levels of access based on their roles. The system implements authentication, authorization, and real-time updates to facilitate efficient task tracking.
Tech Stack
Backend: NestJS
NestJS Framework for scalable and modular backend development
 Prisma for database interaction
PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase) for user and task data storage
JWT-based authentication using a custom auth system ( auth 3adi) 
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using NestJS Guards and Middleware
WebSockets (NestJS Gateway) for real-time task updates (use socket.io or whatever works for you..) 

Frontend: React.js
React.js (Vite) for building a responsive frontend
React Router for navigation and protected routes
React Query for efficient API data fetching
TailwindCSS for modern and quick UI styling( use shadcn zeda besh nest7a9ouh forsa tet3lmouh men taw..) 
Project Features
1. User Authentication & RBAC
Users can register and log in using a custom authentication system.
Role-Based Access Control with the following roles:
Admin: Manage all users and tasks ( Create and assign tasks to users )
Employee( normal user)  : View and update their assigned tasks.
Middleware to check user roles before performing actions.
Steps to Implement
Set up JWT Auth for user authentication.
Define user roles and permissions in the database.
Implement NestJS Middleware & Guards for role-based access.
Secure API endpoints based on user roles.

2. Task Management (CRUD Operations)
Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks.
Tasks include title, description, deadline, priority, and status.
Users can only modify tasks if they have the correct permissions based on RBAC.
Steps to Implement
Design the Task model in the database.
Create NestJS CRUD API routes (/tasks).
Implement business logic for task assignment and role validation.
Connect frontend UI with API using React Query.

3. API & Database (NestJS + Supabase)
NestJS REST API with CRUD routes for tasks (/tasks).
PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase) as the primary database.
 Prisma for database management.
Middleware for authentication and role-based authorization.
Steps to Implement
Configure PostgreSQL on Supabase.
Define database schema for users and tasks.
Implement NestJS services, controllers, and repositories.
Secure API with JWT authentication.

4. Real-Time Updates & Notifications
WebSockets (NestJS Gateway) to notify users of new task assignments.
Task status updates broadcasted in real-time.
(Optional) Email notifications using Nodemailer for task deadlines.
Steps to Implement
Add NestJS WebSocket Gateway.
Implement event listeners for task updates.
Update frontend to handle real-time updates.
(Optional) Configure Nodemailer for email alerts.

5. Frontend with React.js
JWT-based authentication integrated with a custom auth system.
Role-based UI with different views for Admin,  and Employee( normal user).
React Query for optimized API interactions.
Protected routes to ensure secure access.
Steps to Implement
Set up React Router for navigation.
Implement authentication flow using JWT.
Create dashboard views for different roles.
Fetch & display tasks using React Query.
Final Overview
This project aims to provide a structured approach to learning and implementing RBAC, API authentication, WebSockets, and frontend-backend integration in a real-world scenario
